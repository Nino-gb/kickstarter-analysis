# Kickstarter Challenge

## Overview of Project 

Louise want to start a crowdfunding campaing to help fund the play "Fever". She estimate the project will cost over $10,000 and she need help to organize ,sort and analyze crowdfunding data to define the key element that will lead this project to success.

### Purpose

Performed data analysis on various crowdfunding data to uncover hidden trends to determinate and adopt specific factors that will make Louise's crowdfunding sucessful to fund the project Fever. Data analysis will include visualization that will help Louise to view how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

This is an analytical report build using line chart, with data coming in from Kickstarter Challenge workbook. This report measure the theater crowdfunding projects progress by month. The x-axis represent the launch month, and the y-axis represent the amount of success, failed and canceled outcomes. The chart shows that success outcomes have a period of growth from March to May. After May, success outcomes decreases until September. Failed outcomes varies from 31 to 52.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This is an analytical report build using line chart, with data coming in from Kickstarter Challenge workbook. This report measure the plays crowdfunding project percentage of the outcomes with a goal ranges from $0 to more than $50,0000 . The x-axis represent the goal ranges created by goal dollar-amount projected by groups, and the y-axis represent the percentage of successful, failed and canceled outcomes. Canceled plays have 0% outcomes, therefore it make no difference over time. Successful outcomes have the highest % in the less than $1,000 amount range and tend to decreasing from 1,000 to 25,000 amount range , then it has a gradual increase of 46% through $44,999. For failed outcomes we can observe that lowest percentage happens in less than 1,000 amount range and % start increasing up to 29,999. Failed higher % is 100% within the 45,000-49,000 amount range.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 

Both visualization were analyzed by different category therefore they were not aline with this may shows discrepancies if we try to compare both visualization. Outcomes by Launch Date was filter by theater parent category while Outcomes based on Goals values were under subcategory plays. To be able to do an accurate analysis between both visualization I have to include subcategory field name into pivot filter and filter the pivot table in the subcategory plays. After that I was able to see that successful and failed plays outcomes trend were similar to theater outcomes. Canceled outcomes trend was completely diferent. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

With the Outcomes launch date chart we can conclude that theater parent category was most successful during the month of May with a 111 outcomes comparing with a failed outcomes of 52 during the same month. Canceled outcomes trend is under 10 all year. Campaigns starting during the months of April and May tend to be more successful than the other months. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The Outcomes based on Goals line chart shows that the goal range less than $1,000 have the highest successful percentage follow by a low failed percentage in the same goal range. Fever campaign estimate budget may have 8% of success over failed outcomes according with the $10,000 to 14,999 goal amount range.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

One limitation the database have is the lack of geographic location. We were unable to analyze outcomes by state or city. With this information we could be able to analyze the average donation by area and identify trends by geographic segmentation

-  What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? 

We could create a visualization to analyze the highest outcomes based on launch month with the goal range to confirm that May can be the best month to launch a campaign within play Fever budget range.
